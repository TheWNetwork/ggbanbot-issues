## How to report a bug

Think you found a bug? Please check [the list of open issues](https://github.com/TheWNetwork/ggbanbot-issues/issues) to see if your bug has already been reported. If it hasn't please [submit a new issue](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal/issues/new).

Here are a few tips for writing *great* bug reports:

* Describe the specific problem (e.g., "widget doesn't turn clockwise" versus "getting an error")
* Include the steps to reproduce the bug, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead
* Check that you are using the latest version of the project and its dependencies
* Include what version of the project your using, as well as any relevant dependencies
* Only include one bug per issue. If you have discovered two bugs, please file two issues
* Even if you don't know how to fix the bug, including a failing test may help others track it down

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in the Minimal theme, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that the Minimal theme has today have been added because our users saw the need.

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and goals of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible, including describing the problem you're trying to solve.

[Open an issue](https://github.com/TheWNetwork/ggbanbot-issues/issues/new/choose) which describes the feature you would like to see, why you want it, how it should work, etc.
